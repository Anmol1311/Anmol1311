### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Anmol. I am currently pursuing my Masters in Business Analytics from UT Austin :nerd_face:.
I love to turn messy data into strategic insights. I have tools like Python, Machine Learning, Tableau, NLP, Data Science and Network Analytics in my toolkit which helps me in this goal.
